# Hello world! :wave: 
## This is our repository for the _Soft2101-Principles of Software Engineering_ course  *Homework-4 Question-2.*
**We are _Deniz Ziştoğlu and Yousef Yacoub Ahmad Odeh_ for group 4.**
This was our first project in GitHub and git for both of us :smiley_cat:.
We learned a lot in the process of making this project	:partying_face: :+1: .
And we believe that skills and experiences like this are really important and will be super useful to us in work field:woman_technologist:. 
We were really dedicated and focused on this project so we are hoping for a good grade :100:.
